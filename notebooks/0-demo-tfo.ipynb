    "We seek your final approval to invest a minimum of $10 million in a co-investment opportunity alongside KKR and Veritas (co-lead) to acquire Cotiviti, a leading provider of payment integrity technology and services to healthcare payors in the U.S., helping them improve payment accuracy before and after claims are paid by seeking to identify inaccurate or fraudulent claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transaction values Cotiviti at a TEV of $10.5 billion (pre fees and expenses), or ~12.4x 2023E EBITDA. This compares favorably versus precedent transaction comps that have traded at an average LTM / NTM Adj EBITDA multiple of ~20x / 17x. Veritas, which currently wholly owns the company, will be selling 50% of the stake to KKR and retain the remaining 50% by selling it to its latest fund, Veritas Capital Fund VIII. Post transaction, KKR and Veritas would share equal ownership and joint control of Cotiviti.\n",
    "\n",
    "KKR's base case assumes multiple expansion which implies a 2.8x/2.4x gross/net MOIC to clients and 23.2%/19.0% gross/net IRR to clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transaction and Valuation Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "KKR has agreed to buy a 50% stake in Veritas owned Cotiviti valuing the company at a TEV of $10.5 billion (pre fees and expenses), or ~12.4x 2023E EBITDA of $845 million. Veritas would be selling the remaining 50% of its stake in Cotiviti to its latest fund (“Veritas Capital Fund VIII”) from its earlier funds. Pro-forma, KKR and Veritas will share equal equity ownership in Cotiviti at 50% each and exercise joint control over the company with 3 board seats each among other control provisions. The PF TEV of the company post the transaction would be $10.8 billion. Expected financing includes $5 billion in debt (detaching at ~5.7x EBITDA) and ~$6 billion of common equity with ~$3 billion coming from KKR Funds and co-investors, and ~$3 billion from Veritas Capital Fund VIII and co-investors. The post transaction leverage detachment of 5.7x comes in lower than the 7.5x implied in the initial deal talks with Carlyle in early 2023, which subsequently fell through. Cotiviti’s implied entry valuation compares favorably versus precedent transaction comps that have traded at an average LTM / NTM Adj EBITDA multiple of ~20x / 17x.\n",
    "\n",
    "KKR’s deal team is led by Max Lin (Partner) and includes Hunter Craig (Managing Director), and Alex Ward (Principal) who have together been involved in a number of successful healthcare investments at KKR. KKR has generated an average gross IRR / MOIC of 17.4% / 2.4x in healthcare PE in the Americas. Veritas has generated an average gross IRR / MOIC of 35.0% / 3.1x in the healthcare PE. For realized/partially realized investments in healthcare it had generated an average gross IRR / MOIC of 51.0% / 5.1x.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Company Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Founded in 2014, Cotiviti is a leading provider of payment integrity technology and services to healthcare payors, helping them improve payment accuracy before and after claims are paid by seeking to identify inaccurate or fraudulent claims. These activities can generate material savings for the payors, who in turn pay Cotiviti a percentage of the savings as revenue. The business currently generates $1.7 billion in revenues and $845 million in EBITDA translating to ~50% margins. The company works with more than 300 clients, including all of the top 25 plans in the United States, to deliver higher-performing payment accuracy, risk adjustment, quality improvement, network and clinical analytics, and consumer engagement programs. It analyzes over $1 trillion of annual healthcare spend and generates ~$9 billion of annual cost savings for customers. Payment integrity is a mission critical function for health insurers and represents a $5-7 billion total addressable market expected to grow 5-7% over the next five years. Cotiviti’s served market is expected to outpace the overall market given the company’s attractive portfolio mix indexed to higher growth pre-pay solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cotiviti’s business could be broadly divided into the following categories based on the services offered by the company:\n",
    "\n",
    "Payment Integrity (“PI”): This is the primary service offered by the company and accounts for ~80% of the revenue. It includes reviewing claims for payment accuracy in pre-payment (prospective) & post-payment (retrospective). Cotiviti offers a full suite of pre-pay and post-pay payment integrity solutions.\n",
    "Other: Remaining ~20% revenue comes from several non-core offerings, including Risk Adjustment (seek to ensure accurate payment from government for Medicare Advantage plans), Performance Analytics & Quality (help payors improve clinical quality scores), Retail (payment integrity for retailers). These offerings present additional growth vectors for the company that has traditionally focused on payment integrity solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Petiole base case assumes no multiple uplift with a 11.9x NTM EBITDA exit multiple representing a gross/net to clients MOIC of 2.4x and 2.1x, and a gross/net to clients IRR of 18.9% and 15.1%. KKR's base case assumes an exit multiple of 14.0x NTM EBITDA (vs entry multiple of 11.9x implied NTM EBITDA), 7.6% organic revenue CAGR (vs. 5.6% 2019-2023 CAGR), 10.3% revenue growth pro forma for M&A, organic EBITDA margin expansion to 54.8% (from current 51%), and an exit in 2028. The returns imply a gross/net IRR to clients of 23.2% and 19.0%, and a gross/net to clients MOIC of 2.8x and 2.4x. Exit route would be through a financial or strategic sale given historic interest from both sides. The interest coverage ratio remains above 2x in the base case with comfort around the ability to cut down on growth-oriented capex and M&A if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "KKR's base case value creation drivers are approximately 2/3 from revenue growth and a 1/3 from multiple expansion. 3/4 of revenue growth will be generated organically with the remaining 1/4 coming from M&A. Main drivers to revenue growth will come through upselling and cross selling existing and new lines of business, supported by product innovation through R&D initiatives and add-on M&A derived through a proven acquisition playbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Investment Merits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operates as a leading provider in a large and growing market: Payment integrity is a $5-7 billion market poised to grow at 5-7% underpinned by secular growth drivers such as claims volumes, medical inflation, and increasing complexity in the healthcare system necessitating continued innovation and customization of payment policy. Bain projects a served market growth of 6-8%, and Cotiviti’s implied market growth of 7- 10%. The company's strong product offering in pre-pay make it well-positioned to benefit from the segment’s differential growth rate of 9-11%.\n",
    "- Offers high quality solutions with positive customer feedback: Cotiviti receives exceptionally positive customer feedback, with 9/10 customer satisfaction and differentiated customer value proposition in three of four segments. In the core Payment Policy Management (PPM) solution, Cotiviti outperforms Optum by 17% in value proposition, with net promoter score (NPS) of 80% vs. 33% for Optum.\n",
    "- Longstanding customer relationships with a compelling value proposition: The company offers a compelling value proposition for health insurers by generating ~$9 billion in annual cost savings representing ~7% EPS contribution for payor customers, driven by a proprietary library of 25mm edits. Cotiviti has a gross customer retention rate of 99%.\n",
    "Virtuous cycle of innovation underpinned by proprietary edits and longitudinal patient database: Cotiviti has the component parts – longitudinal proprietary claims data + analytics team + software substrate – to successfully execute on R&D initiatives and drive increased efficiencies through AI/ML. Since 2019, Cotiviti has launched 18 new solutions and unlocked ~$2 billion of SAM.\n",
    "- Attractive growth algorithm with the potential to drive sustainable top-line growth: Cotiviti has exhibited historical payment integrity revenue CAGR of 7% (LTM Dec 2019 - Jun 2023) driven by mix of existing clients (4%) and new logos (3%). Going forward, a multi-billion revenue opportunity is supported by multiple growth levers, including medical inflation, adoption of existing edits, upsell of new edits, cross-sell of new solutions, and penetration of new customers.\n",
    "- Multiple value creation levers to further accelerate growth with experienced management team to execute: The sponsor has identified several growth opportunities, including investments in sales and marketing, R&D, and risk adjustment optimization. Additionally, a historical track record of successful integration of acquisitions and exposure to multiple attractive areas present Cotiviti with an opportunity to grow further through M&A in a fragmented industry.\n",

    "METHODOLOGY FOR PROJECTED PERFORMANCE OF ALTERYX CO-INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY\n",
    "To derive the projected “net multiple on invested capital” (or “Net MOIC”) for the proposed co-investment opportunity in Alteryx (the “Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity”), the projected gross multiple of such Co-Investment\n",
    "Opportunity is reduced by an estimated expense ratio. Because investors in the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity will not pay management fees or carried interest, the net performance included in this Presentation does\n",
    "not reflect the deduction of such fees or carried interest. There is a 3% cap on expenses that can be charged to investors in the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity.\n",
    "The net multiple on invested capital was calculated by applying a 3% expense ratio to the projected gross multiple. Because this is the highest expense ratio that can be charged to investors in the Alteryx Co-Investment\n",
    "Opportunity, Clearlake and Insight believe this is a reasonable methodology to estimate the projected net multiple but is not the actual net multiple with respect to any investment in Alteryx.\n",
    "The projected “net IRR” of the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity is calculated by reducing the projected cash inflow from such Co-Investment Opportunity by the same 3%. Clearlake and Insight believe this will yield a\n",
    "projected net IRR consistent with how the projected net multiple is calculated. This also represents what Clearlake and Insight believe to be a reasonable methodology to estimate the projected net IRR based on the highest\n",
    "expense ratio that can be charged to investors in the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity, but any such projected information is not the actual net IRR with respect to any investment in Alteryx.\n",
    "Because the projected net performance information for the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity included in this Presentation relies upon the application of assumptions that were not experienced by individual investors that\n",
    "are indirectly invested in Alteryx through a Clearlake or Insight Private Equity Fund, the projected net performance information in this Presentation with respect to the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity, like all projected\n",
    "information or targets, is for illustrative purposes only, and the actual net investment performance an investor indirectly invested in Alteryx through Clearlake or Insight may vary significantly and may be materially different.\n",
    "In addition, there are other reasonable methodologies or assumptions Clearlake and Insight could have used in calculating the projected net performance of the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity, which may lead to higher\n",
    "expense ratios or more accurate net performance figures than those presented herein.\n",
    "The performance information for the Alteryx Co-Investment Opportunity included in this Presentation is projected performance that is hypothetical. Investors should consider the limits of hypothetical performance when\n",
    "making an investment decision. The projected performance has been prepared based on various assumptions made by Clearlake and Insight, which are disclosed above. Clearlake and Insight believe these assumptions to\n",
    "be reasonable; however, different assumptions would result in different projected performance results, which could be higher or lower than the projected performance shown, and could be materially lower. Actual\n",
    "performance results likely will differ from the projected performance shown, and may be higher or lower than the projected performance shown, and could be materially lower.\n",
